## Introduction

I wanted to write an ai for a board game but seeing that most like chess or checkers have been done before a million times over. I opted for a variant of checkers/draughts known as [Turkish Draughts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_draughts). The rules are fairly similar to traditional checkers/draughts with the main difference being pieces move along the axis as opposed to diagonally. This project includes the ai, and a frontend ui, to play the game against it or watch a match between the two ai.

## Game Rules

//Like checkers but pieces move along axis
//Kings move any distance 
//Pieces have to take if afforded the opportunity
//Win conditions
